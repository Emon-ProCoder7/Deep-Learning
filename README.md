<h1 align = 'center'> Classification Model Building with Neural Network </h1> 

#### Project Goals
For this project I have explored [Heart Failure Clinical dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) to predict the survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction, and other factors such as age, anemia, diabetes, and so on.
<br> <br>
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
